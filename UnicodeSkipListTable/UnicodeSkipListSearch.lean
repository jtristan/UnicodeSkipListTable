The unicode skip list data structure is used to represent the set of characters
that have some property. The data structure is precomputed using the
tool in script/unicode.

We use a variant of the skip list data structure that takes advantage
of the distribution of character properties for the common properties of
interest. Considering the sequence of codepoints that satisfy a given
property, they tend to appear is small ranges that are clustered. These
clusters are separated from each other by large ranges of codepoints that
do not satisfy the property. We refer to such clusters as runs.

The data structure takes advantage of this by representing the set
using an array of 32 bit integers (the outer array that allows to skip)
and an array of 8 bit integers. The integers of the outer array
contains enough information to let us locate in which run a codepoint
belong, and we call it `runs`. The bytes of the inner array, which we call
`offsets` record the length of the ranges. Large ranges of codepoints
that do not satisfy a property appear in the offsets as 0.

A key property of the inner array is that the index of range tells us
whether the property holds for that range or not. Therefore, to find
whether a character has a property, we first use the `runs` array
to locate where to search in the `offsets` array. We can then locate the
character in the offsets array to determine the parity of its position.

The 32 bit integers in the outer array encode the following
information. The 11 most significants bits are an index into the inner
array, pointing to the start of a run. The 21 least significant bits
point to the codepoint one past the run.

As an example, consider some property that would hold for the set of
codepoints: {100, 101, 103, 104, 105, 108, 109, 2000, 2001, 2002, 2004}

The offsets would be: [100,2,1,3,2,2,0,3,1,1,0]
Before packing into a 32 bit integer, the runs would be: [(0,2000),(5,1114112)]

The idea for this data structure comes from Rust:
